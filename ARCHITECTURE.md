# AI Workflow Orchestrator - Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The AI Workflow Orchestrator is a sophisticated multi-agent coordination system built on Cardano blockchain technology. It serves as an autonomous project manager that orchestrates specialized AI agents to complete complex business goals.

## Core Components

### 1. MCP Server (`src/index.ts`)

The main entry point that exposes the orchestrator as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It handles:

- Tool registration and invocation
- Resource management
- Request/response handling
- System initialization

**Key Tools:**
- `create_workflow`: Initiates new workflows
- `get_workflow_status`: Monitors progress
- `register_agent`: Adds new agents
- `discover_agents`: Finds suitable agents
- `validate_agent_output`: Ensures quality
- `execute_payment`: Handles ADA payments
- `log_workflow_event`: Records on-chain
- `negotiate_with_agent`: Price negotiation

### 2. Workflow Orchestrator (`src/orchestrator/WorkflowOrchestrator.ts`)

The brain of the system that coordinates all workflow activities:

**Responsibilities:**
- Workflow lifecycle management
- Task queue management
- Agent assignment optimization
- Progress monitoring
- Retry logic for failed tasks
- Cost tracking and budget management

**Key Algorithms:**
- Dependency resolution for task execution order
- Agent selection based on multi-criteria scoring:
  - Reputation: 70% weight
  - Cost: 30% weight
- Dynamic task re-assignment on failure

### 3. Task Decomposer (`src/orchestrator/TaskDecomposer.ts`)

Intelligent system for breaking down high-level goals into actionable subtasks:

**Decomposition Strategies:**
- **Content Creation**: Research → Writing → Editing → Design
- **Data Analysis**: Collection → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization → Reporting
- **Software Development**: Requirements → Backend → Frontend → Testing → Deployment
- **Research**: Literature Review → Data Collection → Analysis → Report
- **Marketing**: Research → Strategy → Content → Execution → Analytics

**Features:**
- Pattern recognition for common goal types
- Capability mapping for each subtask
- Dependency graph generation
- Priority assignment

### 4. Task Executor (`src/orchestrator/TaskExecutor.ts`)

Handles actual task execution with assigned agents:

**Capabilities:**
- Agent endpoint communication
- Timeout management
- Error handling and retry logic
- Result collection and normalization
- Performance monitoring

### 5. Output Validator (`src/orchestrator/OutputValidator.ts`)

Multi-criteria validation system ensuring quality:

**Validation Checks:**
1. **Completeness** (weight varies): Required fields present
2. **Format** (weight varies): Proper JSON structure
3. **Quality Indicators** (weight varies): Metadata quality scores
4. **Custom Criteria** (optional): User-defined requirements

**Validation Flow:**
```
Agent Output → Validation Checks → Score Calculation → 
Pass/Fail Decision → Feedback Generation → Reputation Update
```

### 6. Agent Registry (`src/registry/AgentRegistry.ts`)

Central registry for managing all available agents:

**Data Stored:**
- Agent identity and endpoint
- Capabilities list
- Pricing structure
- Wallet address for payments
- Reputation score
- Performance statistics
- Status (active/inactive/busy)

**Discovery Algorithm:**
```typescript
1. Filter by required capabilities
2. Filter by minimum reputation
3. Filter by maximum budget
4. Exclude busy/inactive agents
5. Sort by reputation (descending)
6. Return top matches
```

### 7. Reputation System (`src/reputation/ReputationSystem.ts`)

Sophisticated reputation tracking with on-chain verification:

**Reputation Score Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = 
  (Success Rate × 0.30) +
  (Average Quality × 0.35) +
  (Recent Performance × 0.25) +
  (Experience Factor × 0.10)
```

**Tier System:**
- 🥉 Bronze: < 10 tasks
- 🥈 Silver: 10+ tasks, 75%+ score
- 🥇 Gold: 20+ tasks, 85%+ score
- 💎 Platinum: 50+ tasks, 95%+ score

**Badge Awards:**
- Experience: Veteran (100+), Expert (50+), Experienced (10+)
- Quality: Quality Master (95%+), High Quality (90%+)
- Consistency: Perfect Streak (10 consecutive successes)
- Speed: Fast Responder (< 1 hour avg)
- Versatility: Multi-Skilled (5+ capabilities)

### 8. Cardano Integration (`src/blockchain/CardanoIntegration.ts`)

Blockchain interface for transparency and payments:

**Core Functions:**

#### On-Chain Logging
Records workflow events as transaction metadata:
- Workflow creation
- Task assignments
- Payments
- Validation results
- Reputation updates

#### Micropayments
Automated ADA transfers to agents:
```typescript
1. Build transaction with cardano-serialization-lib
2. Sign with orchestrator wallet
3. Submit to Cardano network
4. Wait for confirmation
5. Log payment metadata
```

#### Escrow Contracts
Smart contract for secure fund holding:
```typescript
1. Lock funds in Plutus contract
2. Define release conditions
3. Automatic release on task completion
4. Refund on quality failure
```

#### Reputation Verification
Cross-reference on-chain reputation data:
- Total tasks from blockchain
- Payment history verification
- Dispute resolution records
